            story= _ "While Bazur and Isolde fought their way towards Tath, Asheviere launched a massive recruitment effort at Wesnoth’s northern border. Soradoc was brought under the Crown’s direct control and made a rallying point for orcish mercenaries. Savage warriors flocked there and swore allegiance in return for coin."

            story= _ "Asheviere was well aware she was calling down a storm. She had seen how orcish loyalty was measured only in gold, with chieftains moving against each other as often as the royal army, all the while pillaging the land and its people wherever they went. But the Queen needed soldiers who cared nothing for the ideals of Wesnoth’s rebels, soldiers happy to support any cause so long as they were paid. That it was the pillaged commoners who bore this burden was so much the better for the royal treasury. Thusly a great many villagers paid the price for the Queen’s war machine, often with their very lives."

            story= _ "Shocked by Asheviere’s willingness to unleash orcs upon the kingdom, the remaining eastern rebels, already scattered and disorganized, fell swiftly to the northern hordes. The western provinces — particularly Elensefar — had no desire to involve themselves in another war so soon after Garard’s, a view only encouraged by the imposing presence of Fortress Halstead, with its vast garrison and high walls rivaling those of even Dan’Tonk."
